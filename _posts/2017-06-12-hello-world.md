Hi there.

As it is the tradition for first-time developers ( or developers trying out a new programming language ) to make the code output ['Hello World'][hello-world], here is my first attempt at writing.

I have postponed doing this for about 2 years for reasons i don't even know :) but i guess it time to throw away all doubts and [just freaking do it][just-do-it]

So what's the motivation behind this? I have been a developer for about 3 years now, and one of the major lessons i have learnt is that the more you share, the more you learn. So i believe doing this will make me better at what I do and also help a few people out there. 

What will I be posting here? Majorly software development stuff, but i may also post some random stuff i just feel like sharing which may not be programming related.

Thanks to the guys at [Github Pages][github-pages], [Jekyll][jekyll] and also [Renyuan][renyuan] for creating this cool theme.

Cheers!
